<h1>Background Information</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in Australia making me Australian, my ethnicity however is half Chinese and half Vietnamese. I mainly speak Vietnamese at home as no one in my immediate family knows Chinese. I have completed year 12 here in Melbourne, graduating in 2020. Making this my first year in University studying at Bachelor in Information Technology.

I have a pet dog, he’s reaching his older ages but continues to stay extremely energetic and lively. I tend to spend most of my time at home with my brother, technology or a book. A resolution that I have for myself this year is to try to read at least 1 book a month, in hopes of getting back into reading. However I often find myself on my phone or my Nintendo Switch.</p>

<h1>Interest in I.T</h1>

<p>I haven’t always been interested in I.T, I think it started when my sister decided to do I.T in university and I think that just kinda triggered my interest. I guess I thought it was cool, and a part of me probably wanted to get into game design or something related to games because I enjoyed playing games. However I was never, and I’m still not the most creative person so a degree specifically in designing probably wasn’t the best idea. I did I.T in highschool, as one of my VCE subjects - other than that I have little to no experience in the field. I think currently I just find it amazing that technology is pretty much the backbone of nearly everything these days, it’s how we learn, it’s how we purchase a lot of things, it’s how we organise ourselves, pretty much everyone relies on it and I think that’s crazy when you look at it in retrospect.</p>

<p>I chose to come to RMIT, I won’t lie a part of me just wanted to experience the city life a bit more, because I felt like it could push me to be more motivated in changing how I lived my life. With both the commute and the change of environment.</p>

<p>I expect to get a better grasp of what I.T is and what is offers. I think I’ll learn a lot of basics and figure out what I personally would like to do and where to go with that for my next few years at university. </p>

<b>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </b>
<<p>These results briefly show who I am and how I am able to interact with people and work in a group setting. </p>> 

<b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b>
<<p> My results predominantly show an extroverted aspect of myself, I tend to act rather than think, I don’t often have a plan I prefer jumping into things. I think my role in a team could possible be overwhelming but I’m also able to listen extremely well and I love taking into considering everyone’s thoughts and opinions.</p>>

<b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b>
 <<p>I would like to seek out people who are able to work with me well without any clashes, however I believe that I can work with most people if we can learn to negotiate.</p>>

<h1>Project Idea</h1>

<b>Overview:</b>
<p>The idea is a mobile app used for productivity and organisation. A habit tracker of sorts, or to-do list, however the twist is that it has game elements or attributes that make the user more motivated to complete their set tasks. For example giving awards or achievements to users who complete a number of set tasks in a day or week. And as users continue to complete their tasks more features of the app would be unlocked.</p>

<b>Motivation:</b>
<p>Teenage and young adult productivity isn’t the highest. Piers Steel, a business professor at the University of Calgary, noted in a 2007 study. “Estimates indicate that 80 to 95 percent of college students engage in procrastination. The hope is that the app will allow students and others to be more productive in their day-to-day life, having a reward for completing a task will help students to procrastinate less and work in hopes of receiving said reward.</p>

<b>Description:</b>
<p> </p>


<b>Tools:</b>
<p> </p>

<b>Skills Required:</b>
<p>Will require extensive programming knowledge, most likely in Java (most used programming language in app building). </p>


<b>Outcome:</b>
<p>The outcome would be that the app would help students and young adults be more productive in completing their tasks. Helping fix the problem of procrastination and unproductively in people’s day to day lives. The impact may not the hugest but would still help many people find a way to be more organised with their lives, and manage their time better. It would help impact some student’s school lives and personal lives. </p>
