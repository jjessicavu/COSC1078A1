<h1>Background Information</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in Australia making me Australian, my ethnicity however is half Chinese and half Vietnamese. I mainly speak Vietnamese at home as no one in my immediate family knows Chinese. I have completed year 12 here in Melbourne, graduating in 2020. Making this my first year in University studying at Bachelor in Information Technology.

I have a pet dog, he’s reaching his older age but continues to stay extremely energetic and lively. I tend to spend most of my time at home with my brother, who has been diagnosed with autism.</p>

<h1>Interest in I.T</h1>

<p>I haven’t always been interested in I.T, I think it started when my sister decided to do I.T in university and I think that just kinda triggered my interest. I guess I thought it was cool, and a part of me probably wanted to get into game design or something related to games because I enjoyed playing games. However I was never, and I’m still not the most creative person so a degree specifically in designing probably wasn’t the best idea. I did I.T in highschool, as one of my VCE subjects - other than that I have little to no experience in the field. I think currently I just find it amazing that technology is pretty much the backbone of nearly everything these days, it’s how we learn, it’s how we purchase a lot of things, it’s how we organise ourselves, pretty much everyone relies on it and I think that’s crazy when you look at it in retrospect.

I chose to come to RMIT, I won’t lie a part of me just wanted to experience the city life a bit more. And be able to explore such a large campus.

I expect to get a better grasp of what I.T is and what is offers. I think I’ll learn a lot of basics and figure out what I personally would like to do and where to go with that for my next few years at university. <p>
